# Personal-Loan
Thera Bank Personal Loan Campaign by Logistics Regression

Context:

This case is about a bank (TheraBank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

Objective:

The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans. The target variable in this dataset is 'Personal Loan'.
